# Final_project
The project does development and utilization of machine learning models for medical diagnosis necessitates a high level of professional proficiency.
Brain tumors pose a substantial health risk, and timely identification is imperative to enhance patient prognoses. Medical imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offer significant diagnostic insights into tumors.
The core aim of this project is to leverage the power of machine learning and deep learning models to enhance the classification and segmentation of brain tumors. The research is structured around four primary objectives. Initially, there is a focus on preprocessing the MRI datasets to extract meaningful features by standardizing the data and using data augmentation techniques, preparing the data for subsequent tasks. The project then dives into the classification of brain tumors, exploring a range of models from Random Forests to Convolutional Neural Networks. Following this, there is a creation and fine-tuning of segmentation models like U-Net and DeepLab to achieve precise demarcation of tumor boundaries. The final stage involves a comparative study of the models, evaluating them on multiple fronts like accuracy and computational efficiency.
